# BAKAS_ContactTracingSystem
_Contact Tracing System with Integration of QR Scanning using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript_

**Purpose and Description**

This project is entitled with BAKAS: A Contact Tracing System which is Batangas Cityâ€™s QR Code contact tracing solution to help and slow the spread of Covid-19 throughout the city. The outcome and idea of this project is to have an automated log and record system for all individuals who enter a particular establishment without any physical
contact by simply scanning their generated QR code in the scanner that will be provided in entrances of the malls. As one of the technology-driven responses to the pandemic, this system will offer the community with a contact tracing mechanism for tracking any covid positive patients in real-time circumstances.
The main purpose of this system is to help further decrease and eradicate the number of covid positive individuals within Batangas City, so that the economy would continue to reopen, everything will go back to normal and strive for a covid free and safer community until the entire Philippines heal from this global pandemic and crisis. By doing this system, it will help protect ourselves, and our family by getting enough help and support from the local government during isolation when notified by the health workers through this process of locating people who have close contact to someone positive.

This contact tracing system could be highly significant to the following beneficiaries and recipients:
To the residents and community of Batangas City. This system allows them to register and create their accounts by filling out all of the necessary information in order for QR codes to be generated, which they will then use for QR scanning upon every entrance of any establishment. This makes it easier and safer for everyone because it eliminates the possibility of physical contact with other people. It is also convenient since they would only be required to show their unique QR Codes and will not need to physically register for contact tracing.
To the facilitators and contact tracers. This system helps them to easily track and locate individuals who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, making it
easier for them to educate these people with the health protocols that they must follow such as self-isolation to protect themselves, their families and other people from the virus. This also includes the personnels assigned at the entrance of any establishment such as the mall security officers or staff of the establishment that would also benefit, giving them a more efficient and faster process that could prevent delays and hassle with their security workloads.
To the system administrators. This system provides them with an online storage and platform for generated CTS Reports, as well as the records of all registered individuals. It would be a lot easier for them to manage the data that they have and also keeps track of the real-time updates in the home dashboard of the contact tracing system, so that it will be a lot more convenient for them to work with the local government and contract tracers for faster initiatives and actions in slowing down the cases of Covid-19.

**Objectives**

The main objective of this system is to design and develop a web-based application used for a more convenient and faster contact tracing system for the residents of Batangas City, facilitators and contact tracers.
Specifically, it aims the following objectives in designing and developing this system project to:

1. Provide a more advanced and electronic means of contact tracing.

      1.1. Entirely available to the entire community of Batangas City.

      1.2. A more efficient way to assist the residents of Batangas City and user-friendly interface of the system for easier navigation and access to their QR Code, also making everyone capable of using it without the need of being computer literate.

      1.3. To avoid the emergence of long queue lines upon entry within an establishment, which is very time-consuming.

      1.4. Aims to prevent the likelihood of overlapping data and information by generating exclusive and one-time QR Codes for each individual to avoid duplicates and recurring registration.

2. Creates a much safer platform for contact tracing, avoiding any physical contact to stop the escalation and growing number of patients in Batangas City.

3. To provide administrators and health facilitators with sufficient access to reliable information in a timely, accessible, systematized, and organized manner to assist them in reducing their workloads and stresses that shows the following:

      3.1. Information records of all registered individuals

      3.2. Contact Status

      3.3. Date of Visit

      3.4. Time of Visit

      3.5. List of all individuals that might have contact to covid positive patients

4. Provide a dashboard for system administrators and contact tracers for easier accessibility that shows the following:

      4.1. Number of all registered users of the system

      4.2. Number of QR Codes scanned

      4.3. Number of Covid Positive Individuals

      4.4. Number of Self-isolated individuals

5. Generate printable reports that includes the following:

      5.1. Entry Code

      5.2. Personal Information of an Individual

      5.3. Date and Time of Visit
